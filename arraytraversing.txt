What is the correct way to iterate through an array in java? How do you ensure that you do not over-run the length of the array?

we can use for or for each loop to iterate through the array in java.
if arr is an array of int .
then we will first calculate the length using the length.
int length=arr.length;
so to not over run the length of array.we will traverse from
for(int i=0;i<length;i++)
{
System.out.print(arr[i]);
}

for each loop equivalent to this will be
for(int num:arr)
{
System.out.print(num);
}
